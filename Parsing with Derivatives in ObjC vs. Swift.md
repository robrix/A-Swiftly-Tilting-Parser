# PARSER COMBINATORS

### We‚Äôll use ‚Äúparser‚Äù as a synonym

- Executable LEGOs for parsing text

	- Each one is a tiny program

	- Some parse input directly
	
	- Some combine other parsers

- Together, they match specific patterns

# THE DERIVATIVE of PARSERS

- Might, Darais, & Spiewak‚Äôs 2011 paper *[Parsing with Derivatives‚Äîa Functional Pearl](http://matt.might.net/papers/might2011derivatives.pdf)*

- *Recognizes* and *parses* context-free languages

	- Recognizing: ‚Äúis my input valid?‚Äù

	- Parsing: ‚Äúhow is the input structured?‚Äù

- Validity and structure are defined by the grammar, which is made of parser combinators

---

# OPERATIONS

- Parsing
- Derivative
- Nullability
- Parse forest
- Compaction

---

# PARSING

- Go through the input character by character

- At each step, compute the derivative of the parser

- Compact it

- Use it for the next step

- Return the parsed input as a parse forest

---

# *parsing in Objective-C and Swift*

---

# DERIVATIVE

- Returns the parser that would match *after* the current one

- Stores matched input in parse trees

- On failure, returns the empty parser

- Different definition for each kind of parser

---

# *derivative in Objective-C and Swift*

---

# RECURSION üîÑ & NONTERMINATION üí•

- Context-free languages & grammars are recursive

- NB: Not just the *types*: the object graph is cyclic!

- Key to why you can‚Äôt parse arbitrary HTML with a regexp

- Regexps can be matched with a list, but context-free languages need a stack

- Na√Øve implementations will infinite loop üí•

---

# PROTECTING your PARSERS from NONTERMINATION üòé

1. **Laziness üò¥**

---

# LAZINESS üò¥

### DO ONLY WHAT YOU MUST, WHEN YOU MUST

- Alternations, concatenations, repetitions, & reductions use closures to delay evaluation

- Avoids nontermination when constructing the derivative

- Necessary to even *construct* cyclic grammars!

---

# *laziness in Objective-C and Swift*

---

# PROTECTING your PARSERS from NONTERMINATION üòé

1. Laziness üò¥
2. **Memoization üìé**

---

# **MEMOIZATION** üìé

### WHEN YOU DO IT RIGHT, YOU ONLY DO IT ONCE

- The first time you call a memoized function with a set of arguments, it stores the results

- The next time, it looks them up; memoize ‚âÖ cache

- Can store results in a dictionary, ivar, etc.

- Allows the derivative to ‚Äútie the knot‚Äù when building a cyclic grammar *from* a cyclic grammar

---

# *memoization in Objective-C and Swift*

---

# **NULLABILITY**

- ‚ÄúIs this grammar nullable?‚Äù = ‚ÄúWill it match an empty string?‚Äù

- Equivalent: ‚ÄúCan it match at the end of the input?‚Äù

- Equivalent: ‚ÄúCan it be skipped?‚Äù

---

# *nullability in Objective-C and Swift*

---

# **NULLABILITY and NONTERMINATION üí•**

- Nullability walks the grammar *eagerly*, defeating laziness üò¥

- Nullability computes pass/fail, not a structure; e.g.:

		Œ¥(ùêø) = Œ¥(ùêø) Œ± | œµ

	Can‚Äôt finish & memoize before recurring, thus defeating memoization üìé

# PROTECTING your PARSERS from NONTERMINATION üòé

1. Laziness üò¥
2. Memoization üìé
3. **~~*Math*~~ Fixed points üî®‚òùÔ∏è**

---

# **~~*MATH*~~ FIXED POINTS üî®‚òùÔ∏è**

- If `ùëì(ùë•) = ùë•`, `ùëì` is fixed at `ùë•`; `ùë•¬≤` is fixed at `0` and `1`

- If `ùêø` is nullable, `Œ¥(ùêø)` is null, otherwise empty

- Any fixpoints of `Œ¥` are likewise either null or empty

- Interpret `Œ¥(ùêø) = Œ¥(ùêø) Œ± | œµ` as a fixpoint of `Œ¥`

- Iterate `Œ¥‚Åø(ùêø)` from `Œ¥‚Å∞(ùêø) = false` until `Œ¥‚Åø(ùêø) = Œ¥‚Åø‚Åª¬π(ùêø)`  (Kleene fixpoint theorem)

---

# *fixpoints in Objective-C and Swift*

---

# **PARSE FOREST**

- Construct and return any matched parse trees

- Apply reductions

	- This is how you construct *your* objects

- If > 1 parser matched the input, > 1 parse tree in the parse forest

	- This means there‚Äôs ambiguity in the grammar üò®

---

# *parse forest in Objective-C and Swift*

---

# **WITHOUT COMPACTION**

> *‚ÄúThe implementation is brief. The code is pure. The theory is elegant. So, how does this perform in practice? In brief, it is awful.‚Äù*

- Derivative of concatenation *doubles* grammar size

- Worst case: O(2¬≤*‚Åø**G*¬≤) : *G* = grammar size, *n* = input length üí•

---

# **COMPACTION**

- Replace complex parsers with simpler equivalents

- Enables better performance

	- Worst case still terrible

	- Expected case (unambiguous grammars) is O(*nG*)

	- Quite reasonable in practice; *no* algorithm is fast under ambiguity

---

# *compaction in Objective-C and Swift*

---

# **COMPACTION in the FUTURE**

- Generally must compact after derivative, or else cyclic ‚Üí üí•

	- Can we avoid complex parsers altogether in some cases?

- Enables better features

	- Incremental results: üî¢ vs. 1Ô∏è‚É£‚Ä¶2Ô∏è‚É£‚Ä¶3Ô∏è‚É£‚Ä¶4Ô∏è‚É£‚Ä¶

	- (Good) error reporting?

	- Disambiguation? ‚ú®

---

# **CHALLENGES in OBJC & SWIFT**

- Understanding the paper is hard üòñ

- ObjC & Swift are reference counted

	- Cyclic grammars = refcycles (unless handled specially)

	- Potential solution: a refcycle-breaking combinator

- Pattern matching cyclic grammars is tricky

---

# **CHALLENGES UNIQUE to OBJC**

- Language/algorithm impedance mismatch

- Verbose; dense; splits functions across many files

- Pattern matching cyclic grammars is *really* tricky

	- The language doesn‚Äôt have pattern matching üò≠

	- Implemented pattern matching for parsers *using* parsers üí´üí•

- Nontermination is much harder to solve, e.g. `-isEqual:` for equal cyclic grammars

---

# **CHALLENGES UNIQUE to SWIFT**

- Beta (& evolving!) compiler & IDE üò±

	- No codegen yet for some features

	- Crash-happy üòÇüí• (as of Xcode 6b2)

	- Bad error reporting (ProTip‚Ñ¢: extract nested expressions into constants to isolate issues)

- Some language design/prioritization choices need workarounds

	- Making it up as I go ‚úàÔ∏èüí∫üëñ

---

# **BENEFITS of SWIFT vs. OBJC**

- Much better tool:job match

	- `enum` is a better fit than classes for parsers üëç

	- Pattern matching üòç

	- Operator overloading for constructing parsers ‚ú®

- Stronger typing ‚Üí safer, better program üí™

- I solve *my* problems more; incidental ones less üôå

- Enables me to make mistakes faster, & with greater confidence üé¢

---

# **BENEFITS of OBJC vs. SWIFT**

- ObjC is stable

- `clang` is stable

- Familiarity

- Unlikely to break my code on the day of the talk üòÜ

---

# **SUBTLETIES: OBJC > SWIFT‚Ä¶?**

- It was initially hard describing parse trees‚Äô type in Swift

	- ObjC: sets, pairs, input, & AST are all `id`

	- However, easy ‚â† *good*: üí•

- Can use macros & dynamic proxies in ObjC

	- No real equivalents in Swift üòï

	- *Had* to use macros & dynamic proxies in ObjC üòû

---

# **SUBTLETIES: SWIFT > OBJC‚Ä¶?**

- *Much* more readable with `enum`/pattern matching

	- Wasn‚Äôt sure this approach would work 1w ago üò∞

	- If not, same solution as ObjC, with beta tools üò°

- `@auto_closure` & operators are ‚ú® for grammars

	- Potentially masks refcycles

	- Hard to break cycles automatically *or* manually

---

# **ADVANTAGE: SWIFT**

- Objective-C is the wrong tool for the job

- Swift can access Apple‚Äôs frameworks & customers

- Much more sound theoretically

- Much more sound practically

	- Safer

	- More productive

	- Increasingly, *fast fast fast*
