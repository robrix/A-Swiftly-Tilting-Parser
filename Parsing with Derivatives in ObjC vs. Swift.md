# PARSER COMBINATORS are NOT SCARY

### We’ll use “parser” as a synonym.

- Executable LEGOs for parsing text

	- Each one is a tiny program

	- Some parse input directly
	
	- Some combine other parsers

- Together, they match specific patterns

# THE DERIVATIVE of PARSERS is ALSO NOT SCARY

- Might, Darais, & Spiewak’s 2011 paper *[Parsing with Derivatives—a Functional Pearl](http://matt.might.net/papers/might2011derivatives.pdf)*

- *Recognizes* and *parses* programming languages*

	- Recognizing: “is my input valid?”

	- Parsing: “how is the input structured?”

- Validity and structure are defined by the grammar, which is made of parser combinators

*Technically, context-free languages
