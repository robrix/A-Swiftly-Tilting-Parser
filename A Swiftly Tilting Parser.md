^This URL and my contact information will be repeated at the end.

^We’re going to be talking about the Derivative of Parsers. There’s going to be a _small_ amount of theory, and then we’ll explain the algorithm by contrasting its implementation in Objective-C and Swift.

^Don’t worry if you miss some of the theory: the code will explain, and there won’t be a test.

# **THE DERIVATIVE of PARSERS**

- Might, Darais, & Spiewak’s 2011 paper *[Parsing with Derivatives—a Functional Pearl](http://matt.might.net/papers/might2011derivatives.pdf)*

- Recognizes and parses context-free languages

	- Recognizing: “is my input valid?”

	- Parsing: “how is the input structured?”

- Validity and structure are defined by the grammar, which is made of parser combinators

^The derivative of parsers, defined in the listed paper, is an algorithm for recognizing & parsing context-free languages.

^(“Context-free” is a mathematical notion the opposite of “context-sensitive”; for our purposes, we can think of “context-free languages” as meaning “programming languages” while “context-sensitive languages” would be “natural languages.” So the takeaway is that this algorithm will work on Ruby or C, but not Chinese or English.)

^Recognizing a language means testing whether or not a given input is valid.

^Parsing returns the structure of the input with respect to the language’s grammar; e.g. the tree structure of nested expressions. If it parses, it’s valid, and if it doesn’t parse, it’s invalid, so we’re only going to consider parsing from here on in.

^Both parsing and recognition are defined by a grammar, which is made up of parser combinators.

---

# **PARSER COMBINATORS**

### (We’ll use “parser” as a synonym)

- Executable LEGOs for parsing text

	- Each one is a tiny program

	- Some parse input directly
	
	- Some combine other parsers

- Put together, they match patterns in text

^Parser combinators, or parsers, are kind of like executable LEGOs for parsing text.

^Each one parses one very simple kind of pattern, either parsing input directly or combining other parsers—hence _combinators_.

^When you assemble simple parsers together like this, the result is a more complex parser which parses a grammar. For our purposes, the word “grammar” refers to the specific combination of parsers with which we’re trying to parse our language.

^You can invent new parsers to do all kinds of fun things, but we’re only going to consider a few common ones.

---

# **KINDS of PARSERS**

- _Literal_: match a specific character

- **Alternation:** match _x_ **or** _y_

- **Concatenation:** match _x_ & **then** _y_

- **Repetition:** match _x_ **zero or more** times

- **Reduction:** match _x_ & **map** with a function

- _Null_: match the empty string; hold parse trees

- _Empty_: never ever match

^The italicized ones (literal, null, and empty) are “terminal”—they don’t involve other parsers.

^The bold ones (alternation, concatenation, repetition, and reduction) are “nonterminal”—defined in terms of other parsers.

^Now we’ll jump into the code for a look at the terminal parsers in Objective-C.

---

# **TERMINAL PARSERS in OBJC**

```objectivec
@interface HMRLiteral : HMRTerminal
+(instancetype)literal:(id)object;
@property (readonly) id object;
@end

@interface HMREmpty : HMRTerminal
@end

@interface HMRNull : HMRTerminal
+(instancetype)captureForest:(NSSet *)forest;
@property (readonly) NSSet *parseForest;
@end
```

^This is pretty standard fare. Each kind of parser combinator is a class which (ultimately) inherits from `HMRCombinator`.

^With the exception of `HMREmpty` (which is effectively a singleton), each class has a factory method to produce new instances and a property to access its contents.

^Now let’s look at nonterminal parsers in Objective-C.

---

# **NONTERMINAL PARSERS in OBJC**

```objectivec
@interface HMRAlternation : HMRNonterminal
+(instancetype)alternateLeft:(HMRCombinator *)left right:(HMRCombinator *)right;
@property (readonly) HMRCombinator *left;
@property (readonly) HMRCombinator *right;
@end

@interface HMRConcatenation : HMRNonterminal
+(instancetype)concatenateFirst:(HMRCombinator *)first second:(HMRCombinator *)second;
@property (readonly) HMRCombinator *first;
@property (readonly) HMRCombinator *second;
@end

@interface HMRRepetition : HMRNonterminal
+(instancetype)repeat:(HMRCombinator *)combinator;
@property (readonly) HMRCombinator *combinator;
@end

@interface HMRReduction : HMRNonterminal
+(instancetype)reduce:(HMRCombinator *)combinator usingBlock:(HMRReductionBlock)block;
@property (readonly) HMRCombinator *combinator;
@property (readonly) HMRReductionBlock block;
@end
```

^This is pretty much the same as the terminal parsers: each is a class with a factory method and properties. You can see that these parsers are made from other parsers: their properties are `HMRCombinator`s.

^While we’re looking at these classes grouped together, the actual project uses the normal Objective-C conventions for organization: each of these interfaces is in its own header file, with the implementations all in separate `.m` files.

^This can make for a lot of noise and searching around to find all of the different pieces.

^Even grouped together like this, it makes for a lot of boilerplate, and we haven’t even seen the implementations: every one of those factory methods has an implementation and a corresponding `-init` method.

^Everything here would be trivial to translate to Swift 1:1. However, it wouldn’t be very interesting to just review a mechanical translation of the same solution with Swift syntax.

^Fortunately, it turns out that Swift has some interesting tricks up its sleeve.

---

# **PARSERS in SWIFT**

```swift
enum Language<Alphabet : Alphabet, Recur> {
  case Literal(Box<Alphabet>)
  
  case Alternation(Delay<Recur>, Delay<Recur>)
  case Concatenation(Delay<Recur>, Delay<Recur>)
  case Repetition(Delay<Recur>)
  case Reduction(Delay<Recur>, Alphabet -> Any)
  
  case Empty
  case Null(ParseTree<Alphabet>)
}
```

^In Swift, we declare an `enum` representing all of the different kinds of languages we care about. This is the entire thing, by the way—I haven’t removed anything except for comments.

^Note in particular that there isn’t a single `-init` or factory method. The `case`s in Swift’s `enum`s are what Haskell would call “constructors”—each one of them lets you construct an instance of this `enum` with the parameters specified in the parentheses.

^Note also that there aren’t any properties. Instead, you retrieve the values by pattern matching.

^You’ll note that this isn’t entirely free of implementation detail—`Delay` is significant (we’ll come back to it later), but both it and `Box` are only used here as workarounds for (current) deficiencies in the compiler. (I don’t know if they’ll be fixed in 1.0 or not.)

^Similarly, this is `Language` instead of `Combinator` or `Parser` 

^Even so, with this definition alone, we have an order of magnitude less boilerplate. Even better, it’s _declarative_: instead of saying _how to make parsers_, I say _what parsers are_; it’s the _compiler’s_ job to know how to construct & access them.

^Now let’s look at how these parsers are used.

---

# **OPERATIONS**

1. Parsing
2. Derivative
3. Nullability
4. Parse forest
5. Compaction

^These are the basic, high-level operations of the algorithm. You can define other ones—like pretty-printing—but these are the necessary and sufficient ones to parse.

---

# **OPERATIONS**

1. **Parsing**
2. Derivative
3. Nullability
4. Parse forest
5. Compaction

^First, we’ll look at parsing itself—at a very high level, how to go from input to results.

---

# **PARSING**

- Go through the input character by character

- At each step, compute the derivative of the parser

- Compact it

- Use it for the next step

- Return the parsed input as a parse forest

^The parsing operation goes through the input one character at a time. At the end, it returns a parse forest—the structured results we’re looking for.

^Starting with the parser you give it—the grammar for your language—it computes the derivative with respect to that input character, and compacts it.

^This derivative is a new parser, which it uses for the next step.

^Finally, it returns the last parser’s parse forest.

^Let’s look at it in Objective-C.

---

# **PARSING in OBJC**

```objc
NSSet *HMRParseCollection(HMRCombinator *parser, id sequence) {
  parser = [sequence reduce:parser combine:^(HMRCombinator *parser, id each) {
    return [parser derivative:each];
  }];
  return parser.parseForest;
}
```

^The ObjC version is a function taking a parser and a sequence, and returning a set containing parse trees.
It doesn’t explicitly compact the grammar like we discussed before; instead, this is done in the `-derivative:` method.

---

# **PARSING in SWIFT**

```swift
extension Combinator {
  func parse<S : Sequence where S.GeneratorType.Element == Alphabet>
    (sequence: S) -> ParseTree<Alphabet> {
    return reduce(sequence, self) { parser, term in
      derive(parser, term).compact()
    }.parseForest
  }
}
```

^The Swift version is a method taking a sequence and returning a parse tree. It returns a parse tree instead of a set because sets are used to represent ambiguity, and it represents that explicitly within the parse tree as a Choice node.

---

# **OPERATIONS**

1. Parsing
2. **Derivative**
3. Nullability
4. Parse forest
5. Compaction

---

# **DERIVATIVE**

- Returns the parser that would match *after* the current one

- Stores matched input in parse trees

- On failure, returns the empty parser

- Different definition for each kind of parser

---

# **TERMINAL DERIVATIVE in OBJC**

```objectivec
// Literal
-(HMRCombinator *)derivative:(id)object {
  return [self evaluateWithObject:object]?
    [HMRCombinator captureTree:object]
  : [HMRCombinator empty];
}

// Null
-(HMRCombinator *)derivative:(id)object {
  return [HMRCombinator empty];
}

// Empty
-(HMRCombinator *)derivative:(id)object {
  return self;
}
```

^Each kind of parser is a different class in ObjC, so these are all separate methods from separate classes—`HMRLiteral`, `HMRNull`, `HMREmpty`, and so on.

^The derivative of terminals—parsers which aren’t built from other parsers—is straightforward. Literals derive to a null parse containing the input they match it, or else empty. Null and empty both derive to empty.

---

# **NONTERMINAL DERIVATIVE in OBJC**

```objectivec
// Alternation
-(HMRCombinator *)deriveWithRespectToObject:(id)object {
  return [[self.left derivative:object] or:[self.right derivative:object]];
}
// Concatenation
-(HMRCombinator *)deriveWithRespectToObject:(id)object {
  return HMRCombinatorIsNullable(first)?
    [[[first derivative:object] concat:second]
      or:[[HMRCombinator capture:first.parseForest] concat:[second derivative:object]]]
  : [[first derivative:object] concat:second];
}
// Repetition
-(HMRCombinator *)deriveWithRespectToObject:(id)object {
  return [[self.combinator derivative:object] concat:self];
}
// Reduction
-(HMRReduction *)deriveWithRespectToObject:(id)object {
  return [[self.combinator derivative:object] mapSet:self.block];
}
```

^The derivative of alternation is simple: it’s the alternation of its parsers’ derivatives.

^Reduction too: it’s the reduction of its parser’s derivative by its block.

^Repetition concatenates the derivative of its parser with itself, peeling off copies behind it.

^Concatenation is more complicated. If first is nullable, the derivative of the concatenation is the derivative of first, concatenated with second, *or* the parse trees of first concatenated with the derivative of second. If first is not nullable, then the derivative of the concatenation is just the derivative of first, concatenated with second.

---

# **DERIVATIVE in SWIFT**

```swift
func derive(c: Alphabet) -> Recur {
  switch self.language {
  case let .Literal(x) where x == c:
    return Combinator(parsed: ParseTree(leaf: c))
    
  case let .Alternation(x, y):
    return derive(x, c) | derive(y, c)
    
  case let .Concatenation(x, y) where x.value.nullable:
    return derive(x, c) ++ y
      | Combinator(parsed: x.value.parseForest) ++ derive(y, c)
  case let .Concatenation(x, y): return derive(x, c) ++ y
    
  case let .Repetition(x): return derive(x, c) ++ self
    
  case let .Reduction(x, f): return derive(x, c) --> f
    
  default: return Combinator(.Empty)
  }
}
```

^Because languages in Swift are an enum, we can just pattern match against them. Every operation on different kinds of parsers is pattern matching in Swift.

# **RECURSION 🌀 & NONTERMINATION 🔄**

- Context-free languages & grammars are recursive

- NB: Not just the *types*: the object graph is cyclic!

- Key to why you can’t parse arbitrary HTML with a regexp

- Regexps can be matched with a list, but context-free languages need a stack

- Naïve implementations will infinite loop 🔄

---

# **PROTECTING your PARSERS from NONTERMINATION 😎**

1. **Laziness 😴**

---

# **LAZINESS 😴**

- Alternations, concatenations, repetitions, & reductions use closures to delay evaluation

- Avoids nontermination when constructing the derivative

- Necessary to even *construct* cyclic grammars!

---

# **LAZINESS 😴 in OBJC**

```objectivec
@implementation HMRDelayCombinator

-(HMRCombinator *)forced {
	HMRCombinator *(^block)(void) = _block;
	_block = nil;
	if (block) _forced = block();
	return _forced;
}

-(NSString *)description {
	return [@"λ." stringByAppendingString:[self.forced description]];
}

-(id)forwardingTargetForSelector:(SEL)selector {
	return self.forced;
}

@end

#define HMRDelay(x) ((__typeof__(x))[HMRDelayCombinator delay:^{ return (x); }])
…
HMRDelay([self derivativeWithRespectToObject:c]);
```

^I’ve elided most of the class. I override & manually forward many of the methods myself so I can have finer-grained control over evaluation, in order to avoid accidental infinite loops when looking up method signatures if `forwardingTargetForSelector:` is skipped (as it frequently will be due to the target being another `HMRDelay` instance).

^In short, I can’t trust it. Coping with nontermination has been the single biggest headache with the Objective-C implementation.

^I added the description method because I started explicitly logging delays so as to find more ways to aggressively remove them in order to try to avoid causing infinite loops. I was somewhat successful, but the scars are visible in the byzantine implementation that remains.

---

# **LAZINESS 😴 in SWIFT**

```swift
@final class Delay<T> {
	var _thunk: (() -> T)?
	
	@lazy var value: T = {
		let value = self._thunk!()
		self._thunk = nil
		return value
	}()
	
	init(_ thunk: () -> T) {
		_thunk = thunk
	}
	
	@conversion func __conversion() -> T {
		return value
	}
}
```

^By contrast, this is an extremely trustworthy little class. It’s less automatic, but also less magical, while still allowing conveniences such as `@auto_closure` to wrap the construction of new delays.

^I have hash & equality & a convenience constructor as functions, but this is a sufficient description of the class itself.

# **PROTECTING your PARSERS from NONTERMINATION 😎**

1. Laziness 😴
2. **Memoization 📎**

---

# **MEMOIZATION 📎**

- The first time you call a memoized function with a set of arguments, it stores the results

- The next time, it looks them up; memoize ≅ cache

- Can store results in a dictionary, ivar, etc.

- Allows the derivative to “tie the knot” when building a cyclic grammar *from* a cyclic grammar

---

# **MEMOIZATION 📎 in OBJC**

```objectivec
#define HMRMemoize(x, start, body) ((x) ?: ((x = (start)), (x = (body))))

// HMRNonterminal.m
-(HMRCombinator *)derivative:(id<NSObject, NSCopying>)object {
  return HMRMemoize(_derivativesByElements[object],
    [HMRCombinator empty],
    [self deriveWithRespectToObject:object].compaction);
}
```

^In Objective-C, I memoize into an instance variable using a macro. (There’s also another mechanism which we’ll see later.)

^All the nonterminal parsers inherit from `HMRNonterminal`, which memoizes their implementations of the derivative; this avoids me having to do it again and again in every subclass.

---

# **MEMOIZATION 📎 in SWIFT**

```swift
func derive(c: Alphabet) -> Recur {
  let derive: (Recur, Alphabet) -> Recur = memoize { recur, parameters in
    let (combinator, c) = parameters

    case let .Literal(x) where x == c:
      return Combinator(parsed: ParseTree(leaf: c))
      
    case let .Alternation(x, y):
      return recur(x, c) | recur(y, c)
      
    case let .Concatenation(x, y) where x.value.nullable:
      return recur(x, c) ++ y
        | Combinator(parsed: x.value.parseForest) ++ recur(y, c)
    case let .Concatenation(x, y): return recur(x, c) ++ y
      
    case let .Repetition(x): return recur(x, c) ++ combinator
      
    case let .Reduction(x, f): return recur(x, c) --> f
      
    default: return Combinator(.Empty)
    }
  }
  return derive(self, c)
}

	- Expected case (unambiguous grammars) is O(*nG*)

	- Quite reasonable in practice; *no* algorithm is fast under ambiguity

# **COMPACTION in the FUTURE 🚀**

- Generally must compact after derivative, or else 🔄

	- Can we avoid complex parsers altogether in some cases?

- Enables better features

	- Incremental results: 🔢 vs. 1️⃣…2️⃣…3️⃣…4️⃣…

	- (Good) error reporting?

	- Disambiguation? ✨

---

# **CHALLENGES in OBJC & SWIFT**

- Understanding the paper is hard 😖

- ObjC & Swift are reference counted

	- Cyclic grammars = refcycles (unless handled specially)

	- Potential solution: a refcycle-breaking combinator

- Pattern matching cyclic grammars is tricky

---

# **CHALLENGES UNIQUE to OBJC**

- Language/algorithm impedance mismatch

- Verbose; dense; splits functions across many files

- Pattern matching cyclic grammars is *really* tricky

	- The language doesn’t have pattern matching 😭

	- Implemented pattern matching for parsers *using* parsers 💫🌀

- Nontermination is much harder to solve, e.g. `-isEqual:` for equal cyclic grammars

---

# **CHALLENGES UNIQUE to SWIFT**

- Beta (& evolving!) compiler & IDE 😱

	- No codegen yet for some features

	- Crash-happy 😂💥 (as of Xcode 6b3)

	- Bad error reporting (ProTip™: extract nested expressions into constants to isolate issues)

- Some language design/prioritization choices need workarounds

	- Making it up as I go ✈️💺👖

---

# **BENEFITS of SWIFT vs. OBJC**

- Much better tool:job match

	- `enum` is a better fit than classes for parsers 👍

	- Pattern matching 😍

	- Operator overloading for constructing parsers ✨

- Stronger typing → safer, better program 💪

- Solve *my* problems more, incidental ones less 🙌

- Make mistakes faster & with greater confidence 🎢

^I don’t have to come up with class prefixes.

---

# **BENEFITS of OBJC vs. SWIFT**

- ObjC is stable

- `clang` is stable

- Familiarity

- Unlikely to break my code on the day of the talk 😆

---

# **SUBTLETIES: OBJC > SWIFT…?**

- It was initially hard describing parse trees’ type in Swift

	- ObjC: sets, pairs, input, & AST are all `id`

	- However, easy ≠ *good*: 💥

- Can use macros & dynamic proxies in ObjC

	- No real equivalents in Swift 😕

	- *Had* to use macros & dynamic proxies in ObjC 😞

---

# **SUBTLETIES: SWIFT > OBJC…?**

- *Much* more readable with `enum`/pattern matching

	- Wasn’t sure this approach would work 1w ago 😰

	- If not, same solution as ObjC, with beta tools 😡

- `@auto_closure` & operators are ✨ for grammars

	- Potentially masks refcycles

	- Hard to break cycles automatically *or* manually

---

# **SWIFT ❤️**

- Objective-C is the wrong tool for the job

- Much more sound theoretically

	- Inheritance is holding us back

	- Better type system → more flexibility, less effort

- Much more sound practically

	- Safer & more productive

	- Types enable better optimizations → _fast!_
