# A Swiftly Tilting Parser

[My talk](https://github.com/robrix/A-Swiftly-Tilting-Parser/blob/master/A%20Swiftly%20Tilting%20Parser.pdf) about the [derivative of parser combinators](http://matt.might.net/articles/parsing-with-derivatives/), to be given at [TACOW](https://tacow.org/) on July 8th, 2014.

The slides are also available on [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/robrix/a-swiftly-tilting-parser).
